# C(L)M Helpers
This semester I learned to translate some Classical Mongolian with a book
called

```
An Introduction to Classical (Literary) Mongolian
by Kaare Gr√∏nbech and John R. Krueger
revised by James E. Bosson and Nathan W. Hill
```

Because translating classical mongolian is more about grammar and less about
looking up vocabulary, I automated looking up vocabulary.
If you have a digital version of the book, copy the text into a file and
execute the `get_vocab` script on it.

## Requirements
The scripts require some usual unix tools, `Node.js` and `perl`.
On a Debian based system running the following line should do it
```
apt install nodejs
```

## Others
The `glossary.txt` file is a list of all vocabulary from the book.
This project is hacked together fairly quickly but I consider it helpful.
